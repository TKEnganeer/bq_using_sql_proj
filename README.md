# Answering Business Questions for a Music Sales Company with SQL: Project Overview 
* I analyzed the music sales data from an imaginary webstore (a much smaller version of itunes) using sqlite3 to query the database.
* I used a database called chinook.db with 11 tables and with hundreds of rows to gather my outcomes and results.
* I was able to determine the following pieces of information:
  1. Tracks and genres which sell the most in a given country
  2. Top 3 countries with the biggest potential for growth 
  3. The popularity of albums verses the respective individual track sales worldwide
